## Getting started

Create a file called `credentials.dart`, just like the following:

```dart
const SUPABASE_URL = 'ADD SUPABASE URL';
const SUPABASE_SECRET = 'ADD SUPABASE SECRET';

const EMAIL = 'example@email.com'; // ADD YOUR EMAIL HERE
const PASSWORD = 'password'; // ADD YOUR PASSWORD HERE
```

Don't forget to remove `credentials.dart` from the source control, to not leak your information.
